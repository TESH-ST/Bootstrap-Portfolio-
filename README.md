## Description




My project involves creating a web profile using Bootstrap. For this task, I utilized HTML elements from Bootstrap to craft a portfolio showcasing the skills and work I've acquired during my bootcamp journey.

I incorporated several Bootstrap elements, including the 'NAVBAR,' 'JUMBOTRON,' 'CARD,' and 'BUTTON' HTML, laying the foundation of my portfolio. The 'NAVBAR' serves as a navigation tool, allowing visitors to access the 'work,' 'skill,' and 'contact' sections of my webpage, adorned with my icon and name.

The 'JUMBOTRON' warmly welcomes visitors with a large header and a concise sub-heading, setting the tone for the page. In both the 'skill' and 'work' sections, I used the 'CARD' HTML to effectively present and organize content.

Moreover, I implemented 'BUTTONS' to direct users to different sections and external webpages. Specifically, the buttons within the 'MY WORK' section include hyperlinks leading to my previous projects, ensuring easy access to my past work experiences.

I've also incorporated an 'About Me' section created with a 'CARD' HTML element. This section features my icon alongside a concise description introducing myself. Additionally, I've included a button that will eventually link to my CV, providing visitors with further information about my background and experience.

I've also integrated a CSS element of my choice to personalize my webpage's appearance. This customization allows me to apply unique styles and design elements to create a distinct and appealing look.

I've designed this portfolio to showcase my skills and attract potential companies seeking to utilize my expertise
